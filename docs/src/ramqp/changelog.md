## 9.3.0 (2024-03-20)

### Features

- [#59372] add caching to from_context

> This commit adds caching to the `from_context` dependency injection
> helper, the motivation behind this change is easing testing when using
> Annotated types, depending on `from_context` functions.
>
> For example, imagine we have a dependency alike this:
> ```python
> GQLClient = Annotated[_GQLClient, Depends(from_context("graphql_client"))]
> ```
>
> Now imagine that we wish to replace the GraphQL client with an `AsyncMock`
> in our test-suite, to do this we will use `app.dependency_overrides`:
> ```python
>     mock = AsyncMock()
>     def mocker():
>       return mock
>     app.dependency_overrides[from_context("graphql_client")] = mocker
> ```
> However this example depends on multiple calls to `from_context`
> returning the **exact same** inner-function every time, as otherwise the
> dependency override will not hit.
>
> Caching the `from_context` function ensures that we always get the
> **exact same** inner-function as a result.


## 9.2.0 (2024-03-20)

### Features

- [#59497] introduce AcknowledgeMessage exception

> This commit introduces the `AcknowledgeMessage` exception type, which
> when raised ensures that the current AMQP message should be
> acknowledged.
>
> This functionality is useful to acknowledge a message from deep within
> application code.


## 9.1.1 (2024-01-03)

### Bug Fixes

- [#58342] bump fastapi

> https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/a4aa79e0b4cacc6b428d415d04d234a
> 8c77af9d5/fastapi/routing.py#L222-L225


## 9.1.0 (2023-09-13)

### Features

- [#57272] allow publishing to a specific exchange

> This is particularly useful as it allows publishing to individual
> _queues_ by using the empty exchange ("").


## 9.0.2 (2023-07-27)

### Bug Fixes

- [#53863] use jsonable_encoder

> This allows publishing (more) arbitrary objects.


## 9.0.1 (2023-07-24)

### Bug Fixes

- [#56918] get_url()

## 9.0.0 (2023-06-02)

### Features

- :warning: [#51925] remove sleep_on_error

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> No one used sleep_on_error to sleep on errors. We used it to limit the
> number of errors and stop the integrations from spamming logs.
> RateLimit should be a drop-in replacement for SleepOnError.

- [#51925] rate-limit dependency

> This supersedes the SleepOnError dependency: rate-limiting is always
> what we truly wanted, and SleepOnError is confusing to use - especially
> during development - as all exceptions are delayed by 30 seconds (by
> default).


## 8.4.3 (2023-06-02)

### Build improvements

- **deps**: bump prometheus-client from 0.16.0 to 0.17.0

> Bumps [prometheus-client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) from 0.16.0 to 0.17.0.

## 8.4.0 (2023-05-22)

### Features

- [#51925] make queues quorum by default

> The queue type has been changed from 'classic' to 'quorum'[1]. The
> primary motivation is to ensure messages are rejected to the _back_ of
> the queue. This allows us to consume as many messages as possible,
> instead of blocking on the first unprocessable one.
>
> Even though RabbitMQ queues cannot change their type, but can only be
> set on declaration time, the change is not breaking. This is because
> queues are migrated on a best-effort basis, i.e. if they are empty, and
> thus able to be re-created on startup. Non-empty queues can be deleted
> manually using the following commands:
> ```
> docker exec msg_broker rabbitmqctl list_queues
> docker exec msg_broker rabbitmqctl delete_queue
> ```
>
> [1] https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html

## 8.0.0 (2023-03-22)

### Features

- :warning: [#53725] Make `handle_exclusively` dependency injectable

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> Previously, `handle_exclusively` was a function wrapper. Now, it is to
> be used a dependency.
>
> Previously:
> ```python
> @handle_exclusively(key=lambda x, y: x)
> async def f(x, y):
>     pass
> ```
>
> Now:
> ```python
> async def handler(
>     _: Annotated[None, Depends(handle_exclusively(get_routing_key))],
>     msg: Annotated[Message, Depends(handle_exclusively(get_message))],
> ):
>     pass
> ```

- :warning: [#53725] Make `sleep_on_error` dependency injectable

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> Previously, `sleep_on_error` was a function decorator. Now, it is to
> be used a dependency.
>
> Previously:
> ```python
> @sleep_on_error(delay=10)
> async def f():
>     pass
> ```
>
> Now:
> ```python
> async def f(_: Annotated[None, Depends(sleep_on_error(delay=10))]):
>     pass
> ```

- :warning: [#53725] Remove `message2json`

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> `message2model` has been superseded by `get_payload_as_type`.

- :warning: [#53725] Remove `message2model`

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> `message2model` has been superseded by `get_payload_as_type`.

- :warning: [#53725] Remove `context_extractor`

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> `context_extractor` has been superseded by `from_context`.

- :warning: [#53725] Dependency Injection

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> `MORoutingKey`, and its `ServiceType`, `ObjectType`, and `RequestType`
> have been removed in favour of a simple `MORoutingKey` literal. This is
> done in preparation of the AMQP redesign[1], which will replace the
> routing key with a simple object type. Users should use e.g.
> `@router.register("employee.it.create")` where they previously used
> `@router.register(ServiceType.EMPLOYEE, ObjectType.IT, RequestType.CREATE)`
> or any similar previously-supported variation.
>
> The AMQP callback handlers now support FastAPI dependency injection[2].
> Previously, handlers were required to be specified with `**kwargs` to
> ensure forwards compatibility, and the design was based around ignoring
> any unused arguments. The new design allows handlers to request exactly
> the data that they need, as seen with FastAPI dependencies or PyTest
> fixtures.
>
> A callback using the old syntax might have looked like:
> ```python
> async def callback(
>     mo_routing_key: MORoutingKey, payload: PayloadType, **kwargs: Any
> ):
>     ...
> ```
> whereas the new syntax supports the following:
> ```python
> async def callback(mo_routing_key: MORoutingKey, payload: PayloadType):
>     ...
> ```
>
> Experienced FastAPI developers might wonder how this works without the
> `Depends` function. Indeed, this less verbose pattern was introduced in
> FastAPI v0.95[3], and works by defining the dependency directly on the
> type using the `Annotated` mechanism from PEP593[4]. For example:
> ```python
> MORoutingKey = Annotated[MORoutingKey, Depends(get_routing_key)]
> PayloadType = Annotated[PayloadType, Depends(get_payload_as_type(PayloadType))]
> ```
> whereby making the previous example equivalent to
> ```python
> async def callback(
>     mo_routing_key: MORoutingKey = Depends(get_routing_key),
>     payload: PayloadType = Depends(get_payload_as_type(PayloadType))
> ):
>     ...
> ```
>
> Wrappers for `MORoutingKey`, `PayloadType` and others have been added to
> the `ramqp.depends` and `ramqp.mo` modules for convenience.
>
> The `MOAMQPSystem` and associated objects have moved namespace from
> `ramqp.mo.{amqp,models}` to `ramqp.mo`.
>
> The `MOAMQPSystem` no longer automatically applies `handle_exclusively`
> to callback handlers.

### Chores

- [#53725] Add routing key to test for coverage
- [#53725] Move `handle_exclusively` to depends.py
- [#53725] Move `sleep_on_error` to depends.py
- **docs**: [#53725] Add a thin Context section to the README
- **docs**: [#53725] Remove 'FastAPI and Additional Context' section

> It's good advice, but ultimately more relevant to FastRAMQPI and already
> outdated in regard to best practices.

## 7.0.0 (2023-03-20)

### Features

- :warning: [#53725] Don't read environment variables

> BREAKING CHANGE:
>
> The library will no longer implicitly read settings from the
> environment. Users should explicitly pass settings to the instantiation
> of the library instead.
>
> Before:
> ```python
> with AMQPSystem() as amqp_system:
>     ...
> ```
>
> Now:
> ```python
> settings = AMQPConnectionSettings(url=..., queue_prefix="my-program")
> with AMQPSystem(settings=settings) as amqp_system:
>     ...
> ```
>
> In most cases, `AMQPConnectionSettings` is probably initialised by being
> included in the `BaseSettings` of the application using the library. The
> `url` parameter of the `AMQPConnectionSettings` object can be given as a
> single URL string or as individual structured fields.
>
> Consider the following:
> ```python
> class Settings(BaseSettings):
>     amqp: AMQPConnectionSettings
>
>     class Config:
>         env_nested_delimiter = "__"
>
> settings = Settings()
> ```
> The above would work with either multiple structured environment
> variables
> ```
> AMQP__URL__SCHEME=amqp
> AMQP__URL__USER=guest
> AMQP__URL__PASSWORD=guest
> AMQP__URL__HOST=msg_broker
> AMQP__URL__PORT=5672
> AMQP__URL__VHOST=os2mo
> ```
> or a single URL definition
> ```
> AMQP__URL=amqp://guest:guest@msg_broker:5672/os2mo
> ```
